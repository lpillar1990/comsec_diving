            At CSD more than anything else Health & Safety is at the heart of
            everything we do. We operate a zero risk policy. From the start of
            every consultation, through to site visits and conversations with
            clients, Health & Safety is at the forefront of our planning.
          </p>
          <p>
            At CSD we believe That the safety of our employees and that of our
            clients employees are of paramount importance. By investing time and
            effort in risk management up front, ComSecDiving can derive enormous
            benefits by avoiding significant problems downstream. Being
            proactive and treating the cause (the risk) is always preferable to
            being reactive and treating the symptoms (the impact).
